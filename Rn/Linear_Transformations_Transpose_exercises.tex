\begin{exercise}
Show $T:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n_\text{row}$ defined by $T(\vec{v})=\vec{v}^T$ is a linear transformation. That is show $T$ preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. \textbf{Caution:} We will not be able to use a standard matrix for this, to do that we need a more general definition of a basis.
