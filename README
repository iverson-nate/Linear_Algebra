Goal: 
*************
Create a usable linear algebra textbook for the University of Toledo 
Math 1890. It should contain proofs, but still be example driven. 
So far our goal has been to introduce linear transformations early and motivate
the rest of the book with linear transformations. Our plan is to cover at 
least till spectral theory. Some optional topics we would like to include once the math 1890 part is taken care of: Jordan Normal Form, SVD, Power Method, Eigencentrality, Least Squares (linear algebra point of view), pseudo inverses.

Commands:
*************
make			(builds linear_algebra.pdf)
make clean		(makes directory clean including linear_algebra.pdf)

*************
Suggested git use
*************
git pull		(update local repo from github)
git branch X		(create a branch named X)
git checkout X		(change to branch)
(edit stuff use make to make sure edits are working)
git add .   	     	(add all changes)
git commit		(commit changes)
git checkout master	(switch to master again)
git pull     		(check latest version)
git merge X		(attempts to merge)
(if conflict edit files to fix then)
    git commit 	  	(not needed if no conflict)
git push		(update github)
git branch -d X		(delete branch)

Some quick git fixes:

(This will revert file.tex to prev commit)
git checkout -- file.tex	

(This will make file.tex the version from the master branch)
git checkout master -- file.tex	

(Abort a merge okay as long as you work in branch)
git merge --abort		

(If you don't delete a branch, X, do this every time you change to it)
git checkout master  (start from master branch)
git pull     	     (make sure up to date)
git checkout X	     (switch to undeleted branch)
git rebase master    (rebase the branch X on master)

Coding style:
*************

We use \begin{bmatrix} or \begin{bmatrix*}[C] for a matrix with preceding 
unary minues.We use bracketed symbols for both matrices and vectors.

To say $n$-th use \nth{n} 5th is \nth{5}

We use $\vec{v}$ to denote a vector v

We use the following theorem type environments (using thmtools): 
theorem, definition, remark, proposition, corollary,example, exercise, lemma
e.g.
\begin{definition}[1st example]\label{def:example_defn}
This is an example
\end{definition}

We can make any theorem type environment restatable the following way:
\begin{restatable}{definition}{ExampleDefn}[1st example]\label{def:example_defn}
This is an example
\end{restatable}

The following will restate (Note underscores are not allowed):

\ExampleDefn*
