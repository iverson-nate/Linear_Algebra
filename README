Goal: 
*************
Create a usable linear algebra textbook for the University of Toledo 
Math 1890. It should contain proofs, but still be example driven. 
So far our goal has been to introduce linear transformations early and motivate
the rest of the book with linear transformations. Our plan is to cover at 
least till spectral theory. Some optional topics we would like to include once the math 1890 part is taken care of: Jordan Normal Form, SVD, Power Method, Eigencentrality, Least Squares (linear algebra point of view), pseudo inverses.

Prerequisites:
************* 

The template we're using uses a fairly complete set of latex macros. In particular you may need to install biblatex and a few other extras.

Coding style:

We use \begin{bmatrix} or \begin{bmatrix*}[C] for a matrix with preceding 
unary minues.We use bracketed symbols for both matrices and vectors.

To say $n$-th use \nth{n} 5th is \nth{5}

We use $\vec{v}$ to denote a vector v
